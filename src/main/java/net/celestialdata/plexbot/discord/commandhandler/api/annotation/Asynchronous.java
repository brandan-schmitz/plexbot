/**
 * An annotation to specify that command execution should be done asynchronously.
 *
 * <p>How exactly this is implemented is up to the command handler that evaluates this command. Usually the command
 * will be execute in some thread pool. But it would also be valid for a command handler to execute each
 * asynchronous command execution in a new thread, so using this can add significant overhead if overused. As long
 * as a command is not doing long-running or blocking operations it might be a good idea to not execute the command
 * asynchronously. But if long-running or blocking operations are done in the command code directly, depending on
 * the underlying message framework it might be a good idea to execute the command asynchronously to not block
 * message dispatching which could introduce serious lag to the command execution.
 *
 * <p>As the command executions are potentially done on different threads, special care must be taken
 * if the command holds state, to make sure this state is accessed in a thread-safe manner. This can of course also
 * happen without the command being configured asynchronously if the underlying message framework dispatches message
 * events on different threads.
 *
 * <p>Alternatively to using this annotation the {@link Command#isAsynchronous()} method can be overwritten.
 * If that method is overwritten and this annotation is used, the method overwrite takes precedence.
 * That method is also what should be used to retrieve the configured state.
 *
